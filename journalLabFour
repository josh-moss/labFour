This week in sdv503 We had our first online classes, I’m not entirely confident with this change and I would much prefer
if it was a physical class, but due to the situation now, that cannot be changed. Unfortunately, because my internet was playing up and
i was feeling unwell, I was unable to make the second class. 

We have been learning about functions this week and how we can use them to calculate a decimal into binary. Because I missed the second 
class I struggled a bit with this but after asking for some guidance from Ali and some fellow class mates I was able to overcome this lab, 
however I’m still not confident with functions yet and will have to keep practicing and researching about them so I can fully understand
how they work.
